            `I struggle with many things in life, as does everyone else on the planet. But one of the things that I have realized that we all struggle with is follow-through, finishing what I start. Sure, some of us are more dedicated than others which has driven our success higher than others, but I can almost promise you that many of us, regardless of how dedicated we may be, have issues following through. It can be financially, spiritually, or in regards to family, but we must admit, we all have problems following through on something in our lives.


            Recently I have been struggling myself to understand what my purpose is. I continue to ask God to give me a sign or a reason to find out what I have to do with my life, and to give me a new direction on where I am to be heading. Ironically, I recently realized that God will not give me more or less of a purpose than I already have. And how have I been following through with the current purpose he has given me? NOT GOOD.
            
            
            I have been gifted with special abilities, yet I decide to use them either for myself, or I get lazy and decide to not use them at all. IT REALLY IS A SHAME. Jesus will not show me the next steps until I complete my CURRENT purpose in my CURRENT position WITH purpose. 
            
            
            We all have to do a better job of following through, and a better job of finishing what we start. IF we all do that, the world would be a better place, filled with more Christ like people, and more Christians. So today, I challenge myself and I challenge you to find and fulfill your purpose with purpose, and finish the race strong, so that way we can be ready for more responsibilities that God will hand us!

            `As I write this, I am thinking about how many people are in this world that have stress, anxiety, worry, and depression. It is a worsening pandemic that effects more people than any virus ever could. Mental health concerns are VERY very real and have an overall effect on someone that can truly be extremely detrimental to their health and others.

            In 2020, almost 1/4 adults in America reported considering killing themselves at one point during the year. That statistic is truly alarming.
            
            
            There are many reasons that this was higher than usual in 2020 (pandemic, unemployment, political turmoil, etc.) but the scary part is the trend happens to be growing. We cannot solely blame it on the Pandemic and the consequences that came with it. We can probably blame it on a lot of things, but most importantly we can blame it on Isolation, or as we now know it, "social distancing."
            
            
            The truth is that we continue to be alone more and more as time goes by. We no longer hangout with friends or family, some of us avoided public places and interactions a long time before Covid started. We have lost respect for one another, but maybe most importantly, we lost respect for our God and for ourselves.
            
            
            We have deemphasized the importance that others hold in our lives, and therefore lost crucial aspects and elements to life we need. As a society, we no longer give extra patience to others, we no longer help others unless we get something back. We talk before we listen to others,  and speak before we think. In fact, we are mindless, believing what is told to us by others because we are too lazy to do the research ourselves. This is the problem... We don't put in effort anymore.  As a society, everything is given, not earned, everything is expected, not taken as a gift of thankfulness but rather an expectation.
            
            
            We must change this. As Christ followers, we must go the extra mile, turn the other cheek, and listen and serve others. Even if others wrong us, we must not further the conflict, but seek to end it. We MUST grow out of our old ways and move into our more advanced Christian faith, which calls for serving others and not ourselves. we should not hold grudges, rather we should forgive, even if we don't forget what harmed us. We need to be bigger than a political party, a hateful person, or sinful activity. Only then can we truly consider ourselves Children of God, and only then can we be mentally HEALTHY and spiritually right. By his grace and mercy he has saved us, now we must help others to experience the same.
            
            
            In closing, I pray that God renews us, energizes us, and blesses us to turn the other cheek and become better people. Forgive us for our sins God, and we trust you to fix any wrongs that we committed in our past lives. Change us from the inside out, light a new flame, and build us a new heart. Give us a new birth, and give us a new breath in our lungs enabling us to work for you better each day. Help us to serve others with a grateful heart. And finally, bless our ministry and our readers of this article. AMEN!

            `Hey guys, first off I wanted to say I am encouraged and excited by the success that we are seeing on this site! We have had about 100 visitors a day visiting our site a day from countries and regions all over the world. Thanks guys, and no matter where you are tuning in from, we are here for you as brothers and sisters in christ.


            I wanted to share a brief story that I recently heard for the first time in a while that summarizes how we should be serving Jesus as our lord and savior. It is the story of the three trees, and it is a story that my family reads every year as we gather to Celebrate Jesus birth and Christmas. It is the story of the three trees.
            
            
            Basically, there were 3 trees at the top of a mountain that grew together. They wanted all to serve different purposes. The first tree wanted to become a treasure chest. The second had dreams about becoming a mighty ship that would sail crossed the seas. And the third one wanted to stay there on the mountain top and become a tall strong tree that would point up to God.
            
            
            Unfortunately, the three trees would soon be cut down, and due to their immaturity, they were not fit to fill the purpose of their dreams. 
            
            
            The first tree would become a through. It believed that it failed at its missions, and that it would never hold anything valuable, just animal food and water. Right as the tree was thinking this, Mary and Joseph gave birth to Jesus, and place the newborn child in the animal feeding through as there was no place in the inn at night. just then, the tree knew it's purpose had been fulfilled, and that it held the most valuable treasure in the universe, Jesus, Son of God.
            
            
            The second tree couldn't be made into a vessel, but it was made into a humble fishing vessel. Just as it was doubting its purpose as a small boat instead of a ship, a storm came and frightened the passengers on it. Just then, one of the passengers woke from a nap, and calmed the seas by the power in his voice. Just then, the second tree knew that it had become a mighty ship to the most important captain and crew to ever live, Jesus Christ and his disciples crossing the sea.
            
            
            The third tree had been chopped, and laid dormant for a long long time in a work shop. The tree believed that it would waste away, useless. And suddenly, the tree was fashioned into a cross. "Great, I will now be used to kill a man, most likely a criminal too. I can never again be a sign and point to God." Just as the "criminal" was hung to the 3rd tree who was now a cross, a sign was nailed into it, stating that hanging on it was " Jesus, king of the Jews." Shocked and humbled, the tree now knew that in fact it did serve its purpose, and that it would become a symbol of Christ for the rest of time, a cross reminding us what our savior did to redeem his creation.
            
            
            The point of the story is that no matter where we are, no matter if we haven't measured up to our dreams, and no matter if we are what was expected originally from us, we still must be patient as trust God's time and purpose in our lives. The trees ended up fulfilling their purpose and ended up being used in a better, far more powerful way than the way that they originally intended. Sometimes we wont reach our dreams or at least reach them the way we want to, and that is okay! Because honestly, our plans aren't as good as God's, and our ways are not as high as his ways. Therefore, we must remain vigilant for his calling in our lives, and trust him to take us where he leads us. We must remain humble, patient, and ready for his next move. 
            
            
            Until then, I urge you as brothers and sisters in Christ to continue praying, continue following, and continue talking about Jesus and what he has done for you. Only then can we change the world in a way we want to that better serves out God. Follow your dreams, but most importantly follow God and the direction that we provides for us as believers.

            `As we all know, 2020 did not go the way we planned. A worldwide pandemic sheltered us in place, closing many of our businesses, jobs, and social lives down for good. Strangely, even with more time on most of our hands, it seems as if most people did not know what to do with it. Instead of unifying together as a country, and more broadly, as a world to fight the virus, we ended up becoming even MORE isolated, due to the nature of the virus itself, but also because of the way that our culture and political conversation has been heading.


            We were not able to put away these many differences, and so, it cost us dearly. Another year of our lives away from family, another year of wasted time for (most) of us not to achieve our goals, and most shockingly, another year with a strange relationship between Christians and the church. 
            
            
            Church isn't needed to communicate with God, but what it does service as is a place for fellow believers to have community, where iron can sharpen iron, and were faith can grow. In tough times we are meant to be together, called to help others, and needed to bring comfort to others. yet throughout most of 2020, our churches were closed to the public, and most importantly, far away from our hearts and minds.
            
            
            This statement is not made to belittle the virus. As someone who had it and had some pretty bad symptoms, I can tell you the virus is NOT FUN. I have also had loved ones lose family members and people that they love to the virus, so I want to emphasize that I am in no way belittling how serious of a situation we are in, especially for older people.
            
            
            I am however, finding myself wishing that I was in church more and more often. I yearn for that small sense of normality, friendship, and stewardship. I want to go and have live music, and maybe that's petty, but I want that. And finally, most of all, I miss the routine that enables me to communicate with God and the regular schedule that I can reach out sincerely and publicly at least once a week. I miss my family that I would see every week. I miss our after church family dinners when we  would discuss our lives, God's plans, and exciting life events.
            
            
            With these stepping stones, accountability and events gone, life for sure seems simpler, but emptier. We may have gained time to ourselves, but lost time with God and his family along with our own extended families. We may even have gained a fair amount of achievements and position in our careers, but we have lost all resemblance of ourselves. In other words, we gained the world, but in the process, may have lost our souls.
            
            
            So this is my call to believers: Lets get our souls back. We can stay healthy in body, but we must get our lives back on track with God and with others. At my church, our slogan is "Connecting people with God, people with people, and people to service." If we lose any of these tenants of our church motto, we lose the tenants of discipleship and therefore the meaning in our lives. Our only purpose is to bring glory to God, so if we get on the road towards discipleship and out of fear, we will succumb to the pressure of the outside world, hoping that we as a church fail. 
            
            
            So, lets make 2021 the year of discipleship. Let's make 2021 a year of triumph. In conclusion, let's make 2021 the year of the LORD!

            `Earlier today I was watching a show on TV that really got me thinking about something. It was a court drama TV show, clearly staged, and broadcasted in the Spanish language. It became clear to me that I would not understand much, however, even if I did know Spanish, I don't think it would have mattered. This show was filled with drama, and yelling, arguing, and other distraught measures in an effort to build enough drama to keep viewers interested. "Why are we interested in this stuff?", I thought, however, I started to realize that I fall for it multiple times a day in my own daily life.


            In fact, most entertainment sources we watch do this, all the way from WWE and NFL, all the way to CNN and Fox News. Unfortunately, we live in a age where lying is glorified over truth, an age where ignorance is praised as "wokeness" and where calm demeanor is determined to be lame, uncool, and even unpatriotic. I sat today thinking, why is this? Why does society prop up talking heads and pundits, while real- talented, moralistic people remain maimed and quieted.
            
            
            I have found my conclusion. Because most people who exemplify manners and a calm demeanor have values. And, It is harder to profit as an honest man. Yet it is also harder to profit against an honest man. The truth is the more noice someone makes, the more attention they get, however, this should not be the case. Just think for a second about all the industries that people feel mistreated by.... Car sales, vacation and timeshare rentals, politics, insurance sales, the list goes on and on.... What is one thing that they all have in common? They all are PROS at talking. And if you do not have wisdom and discernment, you too can fall into their silly traps and mind-games.
            
            
            Yet, when an honest man is confronted by these people's practices, he does not conform as the others. Sure, he may remain vocal about issues and things that he has to deal with. But there is one thing he does it with. Sincerity. He ACTUALLY believes what he is saying to you, and he does not fluff up his message. He or she does not waste their time bickering or complaining, rather, they put their head down and plan to resolve whatever matter they believe it through hard work and dignity, not through raising the volume on their own words.
            
            
            Let us mark today as the day that we start judging others by actions not words, by values and virtues and not flattery, and by respect and dignity rather than their radical "fluffy" opinions. It is time to stand up and speak for what is right, what we believe in as Christians, and what we believe to be God's true word. We should not do it in a loud detestable manner, rather we should do it in a controlled, loving way that embraces all people, yet exposes their problems and their need for God's divine help and redemption in their lives. Only then can we be happy with ourselves, and happy as a nation under God's favor once more.
